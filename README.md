# convex-lens-simulater
 Python program that simulates the behavior of a convex lens and allows users to draw the final image position of an object placed on the principal axis. The program utilizes pen up and down commands to create an interactive and visual representation of the lens simulation

It aims to help students of 8th, 11th grade to under stande the concept of lenes from there syllabus, they should get real time visual representation of the image formation. so they can also verify there answers
